# Topography and Meshes

The **Topography** and **Meshes** sections offer tools for importing, managing, and integrating data. Each section includes two main functionalities: **Import** and **Manager**.

---

## **Import** {#import}

The **Import** feature allows you to upload and integrate external files into the platform. Supported formats include `.obj` and `.dxf`, depending on the section's requirements.

### **Topography Import** {#topography-import}

- Designed for **elevation models**, terrain files, and surface data.  
- Optimized for handling **3DFACES** in `.dxf` files.  
- Only **open surfaces** are supported.  
- File validations ensure compatibility and prevent failed uploads.

### **Meshes Import** {#meshes-import}

- Intended for **3D mesh data**, such as geological framework models.  
- Supports both **open** and **closed surfaces** (manifold geometries).  
- Offers greater flexibility for importing and visualizing complex geometries.

> **Note**: Ensure imported files are correctly formatted to avoid compatibility issues.

## **Manager** {#manager}

The **Manager** functionality is shared across both **Topography** and **Meshes** sections. It provides tools to organize and edit imported data efficiently.

### **Key Features**

    - **Rename**: Update object names for better clarity and organization.  
    - **Delete**: Permanently remove imported items from the workspace.

---

## **Flagging for Block Model** {#flagging-for-block-model}

Use imported **Topography** or **Meshes** data to **flag attributes** in the **Block Model** section (Evaluate).

This functionality seamlessly integrates surface or mesh data into geological modeling workflows, ensuring consistency and streamlined operations across sections.
