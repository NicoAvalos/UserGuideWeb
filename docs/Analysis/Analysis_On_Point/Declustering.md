# **Declustering** {#declustering}

Step 1: Dataset and Filters Selection

* At the top of the interface, select the dataset you want to analyze from the dropdown menu labeled "Comps/Points dataset".  
* If you need to apply specific filters to refine your analysis, you can do so by selecting an option from the "No filter" dropdown menu and then clicking the "Filter" button to apply it.  
* The default configuration is with no filter applied.

Step 2: Main Domain and Unit of Analysis Selection

* In the "Main domain" section, select the primary domain for your analysis. In the image, "lit\_mo" is selected as the main domain.  
* Below "Main domain," in the "Units" section, check the boxes corresponding to the units you want to include in your analysis. The selected units are marked with a check, such as "ADK" and "QMZ" in the example.

Step 3: Declustering Parameters Adjustment

* Define the trimming limits for your data by entering minimum and maximum values in the "Lower trimming limit" and "Upper trimming limit" fields. These limits are used to exclude outliers and improve the representativeness of the data.  
* Adjust the cell anisotropy in the Y and Z directions using the sliders for "Y cell anisotropy" and "Z cell anisotropy" if your analysis requires considering the cell shape in different directions.  
* Determine the number of cells for the declustering process in the "Number of cells" field.  
* Define the minimum and maximum cell sizes to be used for declustering in the "Minimum size" and "Maximum size" fields.

Step 4: Generating the Declustering Graph

* Once all parameters are set, click on the "Generate cell declustering graph" button to create a graph visually representing the outcome of the declustering process.

This instruction will guide you through the basic process of setting up and executing a declustering operation in the software, allowing you to assess the data distribution and clustering within your block model.
