# **Scatter plots** {#scatter-plots}

Welcome to our interactive guide designed to assist you in mastering the art of data visualization through scatter plots. This step-by-step manual will guide you through the nuances of our tool, enabling you to transform complex data sets into clear and informative graphical representations. Whether you're a novice aiming to understand the basics or an experienced analyst seeking to refine your skills, this guide will provide you with the necessary knowledge to effectively visualize and interpret your data. Let's embark on this journey towards data proficiency together.

Step 1: Database Selection

* Begin by selecting the database you wish to analyze using the dropdown menu typically located at the top of the interface. This step will determine the dataset from which variables for the scatter plot will be extracted.

Step 2: Domain and Subdomain Configuration (Optional)

* Choose the main domain of your data, such as "Lit" in the previous example. Use the slider to set the maximum number of data points you want to be displayed on the graph. You can also apply specific filters to refine the data that will be included in the analysis.

Step 3: Unit of Analysis Selection (Optional)

* In the "Unit selection" section, select the specific units you want to include in the graph by marking the corresponding checkboxes. For example, you might choose "AND" and "DAC" to be included in the analysis, while others like "GR" could be left unselected if they are not relevant to your analysis.

Step 3: Apply Weights and Filters (Optional)

* If you need to apply weights to your data, click on the 'Weights' dropdown menu and select the appropriate option. To filter your data, use the 'Filter' dropdown menu to apply any specific criteria that suit your analysis needs.  
* The default configuration is with no filter and weights applied.

Step 4: Scatter Plot Generation

* Once all the above options are configured, click the "Generate scatter plot" button to create the scatter plot with the selected parameters.

Step 5: Scatter Plot Update

* Select the variables for the axes of the scatter plot in the dropdown menus labeled as "X-axis" and "Y-axis". For instance, if you choose "Easting" for the X-axis and "Elevation" for the Y-axis, this will define how the data will be visualized on the graph. After selecting the variables, update the graph by clicking on "Update Plot".

Step 6: Scatter Plot Toolbar Usage

* Use the toolbar to interact with the generated scatter plot. The tools may include options to zoom, pan across the graph, select specific regions, and other useful functionalities like saving or printing the graph. These tools are usually represented by standardized icons in the software interface.
