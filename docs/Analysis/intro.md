# Analysis

This section analyzes the information of the projects loaded in the Elements section of the platform, allowing you to work with point data, data imported as drill-holes, or block models directly. The various applicable tools enable the generation of statistical and specific geostatistical information, as well as other relevant aspects that contribute to understanding your data. Many of the functions applied in the analysis provide graphical information. These graphs share five workable tools on their interface:

**Zoom in:** This tool allows you to zoom in on the graph in a magnifying glass-type manner in general.  
**Zoom out:** This tool allows you to zoom out from the graph in a general manner.  
**Zoom section:** It enables zooming in on a specific area determined by the user.  
**Move:** This tool allows you to navigate the graph by moving the visual scene, thus enabling you to move in all necessary directions to view continuity or a specific area with its values.  
**Reset view:** This tool allows you to return to the default visualization of the graphical result, useful when various zooms have been performed, and the graph has been navigated.  
**Download:** With this option, you can download the graph in three different formats to have it on your device, namely: png, pdf, svg.

## Analysis Overview

### **On Point**

 Explore tools like descriptive statistics, histograms, variograms, and more.

Delving into the analysis of point data opens a window to understanding intricate occurrences. This chapter embarks on a journey through the meticulous process of converting raw data points into insightful and actionable knowledge, employing a multifaceted approach.

This section encompasses eight distinct analyses, each applicable to your point data-driven projects. To utilize these tools, ensure your projects are uploaded to the **'Elements'** section of the platform. The applications, analyses, and insights derived from this suite of resources are designed to augment the work you conduct in the **'Workflow'** section, **for instance**. They serve as integral components for decision-making or for the validation of values.

Multiple functions yield results accompanied by graphical information, which you can save and utilize for your reports or personal organization
