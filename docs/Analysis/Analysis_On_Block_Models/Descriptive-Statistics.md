# **Descriptive Statistics** {#descriptive-statistics-1}

How to generate descriptive statistics using our tool? Following this 5-step process, you will be able to generate and understand the descriptive statistics of your data effectively.

Step 1: Select Your Data Type

* Start by selecting your database, where you will observe the types of data it contains based on its columns. Once you have identified the database you'll be working with, the first step is to choose the type of data you want to analyze. You have the option to select between Categorical and Numerical attributes. In the interface shown in the image, you will find two main sections labeled 'Categorical Attributes' and 'Numerical Attributes,' each listing the respective data columns from your selected database

Step 2: Choose Your Attributes

* For categorical data, you might select attributes such as "Lit" from the list shown on the left side.  
* For numerical data, select the desired attributes by checking the boxes next to each item. For instance, you could select "Elevation" and "Cu" from the list on the right.

Step 3: Apply Weights and Filters (Optional)

* If you need to apply weights to your data, click on the 'Weights' dropdown menu and select the appropriate option.  
* To filter your data, use the 'Filter' dropdown menu to apply any specific criteria that suit your analysis needs.

Step 4: Review Your Data Set Selection

* Above the attribute lists, ensure that you have the correct dataset selected from the 'Point' or 'Comps/Points dataset' dropdown menus.

Step 5: Compute Descriptive Statistics

* Once you have configured your selections, click on the "Compute descriptive statistics" button at the bottom.

Understanding the Output:

* The tool will then generate a table with descriptive statistics for your selected data. This will include:  
  * The number of data points considered (sample size)  
  * The mean (average value)  
  * The standard deviation (variability from the mean)  
  * The minimum and maximum values  
  * Percentiles: specifically, the first quartile (25%), the median (50%), and the third quartile (75%).  

Additional Features:

* This tool also allows you to see how applying different weights and filters affects your statistics, giving you a comprehensive understanding of your data.

With this tool, you'll gain a general insight or a preliminary understanding of the data you're working with, and you'll be able to make informed decisions based on solid statistical foundations.
