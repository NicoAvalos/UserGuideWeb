# **Swath plots**

Visualize mining data trends for Easting, Northing, and Elevation with Swath Plots, critical for assessing geological and metallurgical spatial variability in block models. The generated Swath Plots can be downloaded and saved to your device.

Step 1: Block Model Selection

* Select the block model for analysis from the 'Block models' menu.

Step 2: Domain Selection

* Use the 'Domain' menu to choose the geological domain of interest within the block model.

Step 3: Filter Application

* Optionally, apply filters to focus the analysis using the 'Filter' menu.  
* The default configuration is with no filter applied.

Step 4: Bandwidth Adjustment

* Set the 'Bandwidth' value to control the level of detail and smoothing in the data visualization.  
* The default configuration is with 50.0

Step 5: Units Selection

* In the 'Units' section, check the geological units you wish to include in the analysis.  
* It is important to make a selection to apply.

Step 6: Main Attributes Selection for Plot

* In 'Attributes to plot', select the main attributes for display in the plot.  
* It is important to make a selection to apply.

Step 7: Additional Curves Selection

* Choose additional attributes to represent as secondary curves in grey color in 'Additional curves', useful for uncertainty analysis.  
* The default configuration has no selections made.

Step 8: Generation of Swath Plots

Click on 'Generate swath plots' to produce the plots based on the made selections, and analyzed.
