# **Grade-tonnage curves**

Step 1: Block Model Selection

* Select the block model for analysis from the 'Block models' menu.

Step 2: Domain Selection

* Use the 'Domain' menu to choose the geological domain of interest within the block model.

Step 3: Filter Application

* Optionally, apply filters to focus the analysis using the 'Filter' menu.  
* The default configuration is with no filter applied.

Step 4: Density Adjustment (t/m3)

This step allows you to define the density that will be applied in the visualization and analysis of your model. You have two options for setting this value:

* **Fixed Value**: Choose this option if you want to apply a uniform density across the entire model. Enter the desired density value in the box marked 'Fixed value'. Remember to input the density in tons per cubic meter (t/m³), which means that this numerical value will be consistently used throughout the model.  
* **From Block Model**: If your block model already contains an estimation of density, you can use these data for greater accuracy. To do this, select 'From block model'. Then, use the dropdown menu where 'Density' appears to select the correct column from your block model database that contains the density values.

When selecting the source for your density data, ensure that the values are in the correct unit (t/m³) to maintain consistency in your calculations and analyses.

Step 5: Units Selection

* In the 'Units' section, check the geological units you wish to include in the analysis.  
* It is important to make a selection to apply.

Step 6: Main Attributes Selection for Plot

* In 'Attributes to plot', select the main attributes for display in the plot.  
* It is important to make a selection to apply.

Step 7: Additional Curves Selection

* Choose additional attributes to represent as secondary curves in grey color in 'Additional curves', useful for uncertainty analysis.  
* The default configuration has no selections made.
