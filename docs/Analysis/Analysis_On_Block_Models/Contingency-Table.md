# **Contingency table**

Step 1: Select the Data Set

* In the dropdown menu labeled "Block\_Model", select the block model dataset you wish to analyze. This is the database in which the contingency table will be calculated.

Step 2: Apply Filters (Optional)

* If you need to filter the dataset based on certain criteria, you can do so using the dropdown menu and the "Filter" button. This might be useful to focus the analysis on a specific subset of data.  
* The default configuration is with no filter applied.

Step 3: Choose the Categorical Attributes

* In the "First Categorical Attributes" and "Second Categorical Attributes" sections, select the two categorical variables you want to compare. In the image, "lit\_domain" is selected in both sections. Make sure to choose different attributes if you want to compare two distinct categories.

Step 4: Calculate the Contingency Table

* Once you have selected the datasets and categorical attributes, click on the "Compute contingency table" button to generate the contingency table. This table will display the number of samples that share specific combinations of category values from each column.

Step 5: Interpret the Results and Download

* After calculating the contingency table, analyze the results to understand the relationships between the selected categories. High counts in specific cells will indicate a strong association between the corresponding category values.

Step 6: Download the Results

* At the end of the interface, once the table has been generated, you will see a button to download the results as a CSV file. Look for the "Download (csv)" button to save the contingency table onto your local device for further analysis or record-keeping.

It's important to note that the contingency table is a statistical analysis tool and should be interpreted within the context of the data and domain knowledge.
