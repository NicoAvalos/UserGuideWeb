# **3D Visualization** {#3d-visualization}

The **3D Visualization** tool allows users to configure and generate high-quality 3D static representations of project data. This tool is flexible, supporting multiple datasets such as **Triangulations**, **Drill-Holes**, **Points**, and **Block Models**, and offers advanced options for customizing attributes and comparing data.

---

## **Workflow**

Follow these steps to configure and generate a 3D visualization using the platform:

---

### **Step 1: Select Datasets**

Navigate through the available tabs to choose the datasets you want to include in the visualization:

- **Triangulations**  
- **Drill-Holes**  
- **Points**  
- **Block Models**  

---

### **Step 2: Configure Visualization Parameters**

For each selected dataset, configure the following settings:

- **Attributes**: Define the data attributes to display.  
- **Filters**: Apply filters to refine the displayed data.  
- **Scales**: Set the minimum and maximum ranges for attribute values.  
- **Opacity**: Adjust the transparency of the elements.  
- **Color Map**: Select the scalar bar to represent the chosen attributes visually.  
- **Point Size, Line Width, or Edges**: Adjust these parameters for:
  - **Points**  
  - **Drill-Holes**  
  - **Block Models**  
- **Displays** (Triangulations only):  
  - Choose the surfaces you want to display.  
  - Configure surface **color** and **opacity**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare Attributes (Optional)**

For **Block Models**, you can enable the comparison feature to visualize differences between two attributes simultaneously:

1. Select the **primary attribute**.  
2. Choose a **secondary attribute** for comparison.

This is particularly useful for analyzing relationships or discrepancies between two properties.

### **Step 4: Generate 3D View**

Once all configurations are set:

- Click the **Generate 3D View** button.  
- The system will create a **static 3D visualization** based on your parameters.

---

#### **Step 5: Share View Option**

To share the generated 3D visualization:

1. Enter a **name** for the visualization at the bottom of the interface.  
2. Click the **Share** button.  
3. A **shareable link** will be generated, allowing non-Annapurna users to view the scene without requiring a login.

Additionally:

- A history of shared views is saved in **Share View Logs**, accessible from the corresponding menu.
