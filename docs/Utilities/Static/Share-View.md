# **Shared Views** {#shared-views}

The **Shared Views** feature allows you to efficiently distribute and manage links for sharing your **3D visualizations** with collaborators. Follow the steps below to create, share, and manage these views:

---

## **Step 1: 3D Visualization**

1. Navigate to the **3D Visualization** section from the main menu.  
2. Configure the desired attributes and settings for your visualization:
   - **Drill-Holes**  
   - **Points**  
   - **Block Models**  
3. Keep in mind that rendering is performed **client-side**, so **Drill-Hole visualizations** may take longer to load.

## **Step 2: Naming and URL Creation**

1. While in the **3D View** of your project:
   - Assign a clear and identifiable **name** to the shared link.  
   - Click the **'Share'** button to generate the URL.  
2. Once the URL is created:
   - The link will be displayed to the right of the screen.  
   - Use the **'Copy'** option to easily copy the link while still in the 3D viewer.

## **Step 3: Manage Shared URLs**

If you exit the 3D viewer, you can still manage your shared links:

1. Go to the **'Shared Views'** section in the main menu.  
2. You will find a list of all the links you have created.  
3. In the **'Action'** column, click on the **"..."** menu to see the available options:
   - **Copy URL**: Copy the link to share it again.  
   - **Open Shared Visualization**: View the shared 3D visualization.  
   - **Delete**: Remove a link that is no longer needed.

:::tip
- Always ensure that you have **saved** the current state of your 3D visualization before sharing it. This guarantees that your collaborators see the most recent version of your work.
