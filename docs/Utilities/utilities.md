### **Visualization** {#visualization}

In the Visualization section of our platform, you have the capability to create detailed 3D representations of your datasets. This intuitive interface allows for the configuration of a single dataset at a time, ensuring focused analysis of either Drill-holes, Point data, or Block models. Here, we guide you through the process of setting up your visualization and sharing it with others.

    * **Dynamic visualization** is a **powerful** tool that emphasizes pre-visualization customization, enabling efficient analysis and streamlined output. It is especially effective for sub-celled block models and massive datasets.
    * **2D Slices** are perfect for sectional analyses, offering flexibility in orientation and granularity.  
    * **3D Static Views** provide a customizable environment for presenting and comparing data in a clear and professional manner. Possible to generate a shared view link.  
    * The comparative feature in 3D mode is particularly useful for analyzing differences between datasets or attributes.
